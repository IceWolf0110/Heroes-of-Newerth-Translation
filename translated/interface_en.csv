loading_tip38,"Do not be afraid to lose. Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment. Everyone was new at one point."
loading_tip39,Be nice! A player will often ignore advice if you are screaming at them. Try saying it in a polite tone as a suggestion more than an order.

rap_nonevent_example,The following is an example of an invalid report:
rap_3_nonevent_title,You have opted to file a report for Intentional Feeding
rap_3_nonevent_deposit,"Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of Intentional Feeding. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*."

rap_3_nonevent_li_2,Player died early game unintentionally
rap_3_nonevent_li_3,Player claims he is going to feed but never does
rap_3_nonevent_li_4,Player is under leveled and dies easily
rap_3_nonevent_li_5,Player has disconnected
rap_3_nonevent_detail,"If a player is intentionally feeding it will be apparent in their behavior, usually by running down the lane to the enemies to die, over and over again. Players will often announce they are going to feed, however this isn't always the case. If a player begins to feed they will usually do it multiple times to ensure defeat."
rap_3_nonevent_example,"Player ""1337honn3r"" reports: ""Offender went 2/6 mid and made us lose the game."" This report was marked innocent because the offender did not intentionally feed. Although they may have failed during the lane-phase the offender was simply playing poorly."
rap_4_nonevent_title,You have opted to file a report for AFK Detection Abuse
rap_4_nonevent_deposit,"Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of AFK Detection Abuse. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*."

rap_4_nonevent_li_4,Player disconnected and never reconnected
rap_4_nonevent_li_5,You didn't like them
rap_4_nonevent_detail,"AFK Detection is designed to allow allied players to remove an offender who has decided to quit playing the game. When kicked, this provides the remaining team members with a gold bonus and items, allowing them to better continue their game."
rap_4_nonevent_example,"Player ""1337honn3r"" reports: ""Offender went to the pool at level 4 and stayed there until the end of the game."" This report was marked innocent because the offender sat in the well and did not move or cast spells. An AFK flag was raised, but he was never kicked."
rap_5_nonevent_title,You have opted to file a report for Ability/Item Abuse
rap_5_nonevent_deposit,"Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of Ability/Item Abuse. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*."

rap_5_nonevent_li_2,Player accidentally misses/targets an ability that affects you
rap_5_nonevent_li_3,Player chooses not to heal or use spells that may benefit you
rap_5_nonevent_detail,"Ability and/or Item Abuse occurs when players attempt to disrupt teammates by using specific items or abilities. ""No-Help"" can be toggled by clicking the green circle next to their hero portrait, but is still a reportable offense if used to effect the outcome of the game."
rap_5_nonevent_example,"Player ""1337honn3r"" reports: ""While trying to escape, my ally used a tablet of command on me, and I accidentally got stuck in trees."" This report was deemed innocent because the reported player was attempting to use his item for its intended purpose."
rap_6_nonevent_title,You have opted to file a report for Item/Courier Spamming

rap_6_nonevent_li_2,"Player buys all the wards, but places them appropriately"
rap_6_nonevent_li_3,"Player purchases items that may not be beneficial, but can't be lost when dropped"
rap_6_nonevent_detail,"If a player is mass purchasing items and/or couriers, they often hinder the team. Such examples of this include, but are not limited to: purchasing all the wards and placing them in base, buying a Bound Eye then sacrificing it to the other team, or buying multiple couriers and sending them to die."
rap_6_nonevent_example,"Player ""1337honn3r"" reports: ""Our ally bought wards but placed it so it couldn't see the rune spawn."" This report was deemed innocent because the wards were placed to give vision of enemy heroes, despite the lack of knowledge the player had of warding spots."
rap_7_nonevent_title,You have opted to file a report for Item Destruction

rap_7_nonevent_example,"Player ""1337honn3r"" reports: ""I was at the secret shop buying a Ward, but had to drop my Codex on the ground to do that. This enemy Night Hound attacked and destroyed my Codex."" This report was deemed innocent because the reporter is at fault for dropping their item out in the open.

rap_1_nonevent_deposit,"Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of Chat Abuse. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*."

rap_1_nonevent_li_2,Player uses a few insults about you playing poorly
rap_1_nonevent_detail,"If a player is verbally abusing you or teammates, do not respond to their insults. Players that fall into this category will often sling degrading and racially derogatory terms in hopes of hurting the other players on an emotional level. Furthermore ASCII characters 5 lines or under are not considered Chat Abuse."
rap_1_nonevent_example,"Player ""1337honn3r"" reports: ""Offender told me ""Your momma so fat when Devourer hooks her he gets pulled in"" and he called me an idiot.""
